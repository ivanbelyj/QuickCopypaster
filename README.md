# QuickCopypaster

A console utility for splitting text into limited fragments and moving between them (with automatic copying to the clipboard).
Developed to quickly copy and paste the lore of my setting onto the small pages of books in Minecraft (256 symbols max)

## How it works

1. Set data to input file (.txt) or paste it into console directly
2. Select max fragment size or press enter to use default
3. Use arrow keys to move between the separated parts of the text
   and copy the current fragment to the clipboard
